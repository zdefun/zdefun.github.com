#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The banana is an edible fruit – botanically a berry^[1]^[2] – produced by several kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in the 
genus Musa.^[3] In some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called plantains, in contrast to dessert bananas. The fruit is
variable in size, color and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in starch covered with a rind which
may be green, yellow, red, purple, or brown when ripe. The fruits grow in clusters hanging from the top of the plant. Almost all
modern edible parthenocarpic (seedless) bananas come from two wild species – Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana. The scientific
names of most cultivated bananas are Musa acuminata, Musa balbisiana, and Musa × paradisiaca for the hybrid Musa acuminata × 
M. balbisiana, depending on their genomic constitution. The old scientific name Musa sapientum is no longer used.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The garden strawberry (or simply strawberry; Fragaria × ananassa)^[1] is a widely grown hybrid species of the genus Fragaria (collectively known as the strawberries). It is cultivated worldwide for its fruit. The fruit (which is not a botanical berry, but an aggregate accessory fruit) is widely appreciated for its characteristic aroma, bright red color, juicy texture, and sweetness. It is consumed in large quantities, either fresh or in such prepared foods as preserves, fruit juice, pies, ice creams, milkshakes, and chocolates. Artificial strawberry flavorings and aromas are also widely used in many products like lip gloss, candy, hand sanitizers, perfume, and many others.

*** Meat                                                             :meat:

**** Beef

***** Brisket                                                  :barbecue:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Brisket is a cut of meat from the breast or lower chest of beef or veal. The beef brisket is one of the nine beef primal cuts, though the precise definition of the cut differs internationally. The brisket muscles include the superficial and deep pectorals. As cattle do not have collar bones, these muscles support about 60% of the body weight of standing/moving cattle. This requires a significant amount of connective tissue, so the resulting meat must be cooked correctly to tenderize the connective tissue.

***** Steak

**** Chicken                                               :barbecue:fowl:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a type of domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the red junglefowl. It is one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of more than 19 billion as of 2011.  Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food, consuming both their meat and their eggs.

**** Pork

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Pork is the culinary name for meat from the domestic pig (Sus scrofa domesticus). It is the most commonly consumed meat worldwide, with evidence of pig husbandry dating back to 5000 BC. Pork is eaten both freshly cooked and preserved. Curing extends the shelf life of the pork products. Ham, smoked pork, gammon, bacon and sausage are examples of preserved pork.

***** Pulled pork                                              :barbecue:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Pulled pork is a method of cooking pork where what would otherwise be a tough cut of meat is cooked slowly at low temperatures, allowing the meat to become tender enough so that it can be "pulled", or easily broken into individual pieces. Pulled pork is found around the world in a variety of forms.

*** Vegetables

**** Potatoes

***** Fries

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
French fries are served hot, either soft or crispy, and are generally eaten as part of lunch or dinner or by themselves as a snack, and they commonly appear on the menus of diners, fast food restaurants, pubs, and bars. Fries in America are generally salted and are almost always served with ketchup, but in many countries they have other condiments or toppings, like vinegar, mayonnaise, or other local specialties. Fries can be topped more heavily, as in the dishes of poutine and chili cheese fries. French fries can be made from sweet potatoes instead of potatoes. A baked variant of the French fry ("chunky oven chips") uses less or even no oil.
